                identify you personally. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It

            <p>We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating by email)
                may have security vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not
                possible.</p>

            <h3 class="title-margin">Note on the Responsible Party</h3>
            <p class="mb-16">The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>
            <p>
                Boris Scheiber<br>
                Hausanger 24<br>
                6464 Tarrenz<br>

                <br><br>
            </p>
            <p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines the
                purposes and means of the processing of personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).</p>

            <!-- HERE -->


            <h3 class="title-margin">Storage Duration</h3>
            <p>Unless a more specific storage period has been mentioned within this privacy policy, your personal data
                will remain with us until the purpose for processing the data no longer applies. If you assert a
                legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted
                unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., retention periods
                under tax or commercial law); in the latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons cease
                to apply.</p>

            <h3 class="title-margin">General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on this Website</h3>
            <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR
                or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR if special categories of data according to Art. 9(1) GDPR are processed. In the
                case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is
                also based on Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to
                information in your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally
                based on § 25(1) TDDDG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the
                performance of a contract or for carrying out pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the
                basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, if your data is required for the fulfillment of a legal
                obligation, we process it on the basis of Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Data processing may also be carried out on
                the basis of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Information about the relevant
                legal bases in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>

            <h3 class="title-margin">Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
            <p>In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. In some cases, the
                transfer of personal data to these external parties is necessary. We only transfer personal data to
                external parties if this is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obliged to do
                so (e.g., transfer of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the transfer
                according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, or if another legal basis permits the data transfer. When using
                processors, we only transfer personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid contract for order
                processing. In the case of joint processing, a contract for joint processing is concluded.</p>

            <h3 class="title-margin">Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
            <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you
                have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation
                remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

            <h3 class="title-margin">Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Marketing (Art.
                21 GDPR)</h3>
            <p>IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO
                OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR
                SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH
                PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR
                PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE
                YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR
                DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21(1) GDPR).</p>

            <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY
                TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO
                APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL
                DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21(2)
                GDPR).</p>

            <h3 class="title-margin">Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
            <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have a right to lodge a complaint with a
                supervisory authority, particularly in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of
                work, or the place of the alleged violation. This right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to
                other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>

            <h3 class="title-margin">Right to Data Portability</h3>
            <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in
                fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format.
                If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done insofar as
                it is technically feasible.</p>

            <h3 class="title-margin">Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
            <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free
                information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients, and the purpose of data
                processing and, if necessary, a right to correction or deletion of this data. You can contact us at any
                time regarding this and any other questions about personal data.</p>

            <h3 class="title-margin">Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
            <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us
                at any time for this purpose. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>If you contest the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this.
                    For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the
                    processing of your personal data.</li>
                <li>If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you can request the
                    restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
                <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or assert legal claims,
                    you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of
                    deletion.</li>
                <li>If you have filed an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, a balancing of your and our interests
                    must be carried out. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the
                    right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may – apart from being stored –
                only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the
                protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest
                of the European Union or a Member State.</p>

            <h3 class="title-margin">SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
            <p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
                content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an
                encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to
                "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>

            <p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transfer to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

                any time.</p>
